I host a YouTube channel dedicated to teaching Modern C++ (C++17/20). I believe in "Learning by Building," so every tutorial comes with documented source code.

YouTube link to my channel where all this code will be written on camera:
  -  YouTube Channel [https://www.youtube.com/@Searchability-f3y/playlists]
  -  C++ Tutorials [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ_JuG5-v3A&list=PLJtYz2NTPBwDEvwLPzhafz12UNINdqQ7Q]

**Note:** For specific tutorial code, please switch to the `Tutorials` branch.

The things that will be posted here is the code for:
  -   A large project that I will start building once I have a deep enough understanding of C++.
  -   The code for my USACO (United States of America Computing Olympiad) training
  -   The videos I post on YouTube teaching C++

**Technical Goals**:
  -  Master Systems Programming:
     -  Memory management
     -  Custom data structures
     -  RAII
  -  Algorithms
     -  Graph theory
     -  Dynamic Programming
     -  computational geometry (USACO focus)
  -  Tools
     -  Git/GitHub
     -  CMake
